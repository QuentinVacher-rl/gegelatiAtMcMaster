         * \brief This function randomly modifies the behavior of a
         * Program::Line.
         *
         * Probability of altering the different attributes of the Line is
         * computed as if the given Program::Line was encoded with a word of
         * Program::Program::computeLineSize() bits, and a single bit must be
         * flipped. This means that if the instructions represents n bits over
         * m, then there is a probability of n/m that the instruction of the
         * line is altered.
         * To avoid non-executable line, the alteration of instruction,
         * destination, or operands dataSource index are based on a uniform
         * probability within acceptable values.
         * If the selected Instruction is no longer compatible with types
         * provided by the line operands, or vice versa, then the function
         * will set things right by selecting new valid operands randomly.
         * Although this is biased toward operands volatility, this is the
         * a controlled complexity, and yet random, way to ensure that a valid
         * line is obtained. The alternative (from TPG reference PhD) would be
         * to repeatedly alter the line until a valid one is obtained.
         *

         * altered.
